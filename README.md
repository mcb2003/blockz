Blockz is an accessible puzzle game with the goal of covering targets with movible blocks.
It is basically an extended version of [Javidx9's sliding block puzzle game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7YEaa2otVE)
and even uses [Rust bindings](https://crates.io/crates/olc_pixel_game_engine)
to his [One Lone Coder Pixel Game Engine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine).
Well ... it *will* be that, once it's finished, anyway.
